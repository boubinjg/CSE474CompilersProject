A compiler for a c-like microlanguage written in python. This was the course project for Miami University's compiler design course.
The grammar for the language as well as it's implementation can be found in the part8 folder. Each directory in this project contains 
a new step of the project. The final product (part 8) is a full imperative language containing pointers, function calls, looping,
branching, strings, integers, arithmetic and other features. The compiler translates text files of the micro-language into MIPS. We
got an A on this project. We were the first group to finish this project in its final form, and one of only two to complete it in its
entirety.
